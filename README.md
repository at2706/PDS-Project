# PDS-Project: Tweezer

Functionalities we've implemented:
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Post message
  - Show messages you've wrote
  - Show messages written by people you followed
  - Follow user
  - Unfollow user
  - Edit user profile
  - Delete user account

Special notes:
  - We store hashed passwords instead of in plaintext!
  - We used files to store persistent data
  - We used bootstrap
